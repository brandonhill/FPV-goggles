# 3D printed FPV goggles

### Work in progress

Designed for the [Quanum V2 Pro](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/quanum-diy-fpv-goggle-v2-pro.html) lens and screen, but can be configured for any size components.

I found the styrofoam and neoprene housing and straps to be very bulky, and with the DVR, VRx and cables, very heavy also. But the main reason for this was because the top strap doesn't fit over my melon in a toque, so I can't use it in the winter.

This design integrates the DVR and VRx without cases, and does away with all the connectors except for the battery, so is lighter, and has a single pivoting head strap to allow for optimal balancing. The faceplate area is intentionally small and is intended to rest around the eye socket.

In order to create the faceplate shape, I used this [head model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:758647).
